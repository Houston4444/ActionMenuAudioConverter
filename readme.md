Action Menu Audio Converter is a very simple frontend for ffmpeg, that has to be started directly by file manager.

it can be used in KDE desktop (Dolphin, Konqueror), MATE (Caja) and GNOME (nautilus).
MATE users must install caja-actions, GNOME users must install nautilus-actions to make it works.
Then, when you right click on an audio file in your file manager, you will see actions->convert to format->(OGG, FLAC, MP3, WAV).
In case of video files, it will be actions->extract audio to format->(OGG, FLAC, MP3, WAV).
On right click on folders, it will be actions->Convert audio files to format->(OGG, FLAC, MP3, WAV).

It can converts audio files or extract audio from video file to wav, flac, ogg or mp3.
User can only change samplerate and quality.
